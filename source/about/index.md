Software Engineer | Technical Writer 

> My aptitude for life is collecting field notes as I go. 

Having friends from around the globe is something I am proud of, been to 20+ countries and more trips to come in my way!
Out of 7B+ people in the world, Iâ€™m glad I have the magic to make friends with my solo travels. Deep down, we all have the same desire for life. The empathy allows me to connect to people on a deeper level.

If I am not working on my project or tech blog, I am probably somewhere swimming, having a picnic with friends on a hammock, you can find me in a park or a cafe. 

Something worth mentioning: I am problem solving oriented - I know how to break a problem into smaller tasks, and tackle them each at a time.

Feel free to reach to me via Linkedin my friend!
