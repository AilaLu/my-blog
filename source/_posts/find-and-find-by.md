  `Find` and `find_by` are the methods that are super common in writing Ruby on Rails CRUD, especially in the controller actions `show` `edit` `update` `destroy`.
  What we try to do with these methods is to find the according element based on their indices or attributes, meaning the columns in your model!

  Now letâ€™s see some examples to understand their differences:
## find
```rb
Book.find(params[:id]) #find book id
Article.find(params[:article_id]) #find article id in comment controller
```
## find_by
```rb
Book.find_by(id: params[:id]) #find book id
Book.find_by(title: params[:title]) #find book title 
User.find_by(id: session[:user_session]) #find the current user
```
  With `find`, it can only access the id attribute, and return error when the element is not found. Whereas with `find_by`, you can access to any attribute you like, as we see with the `book title`.
  One thing to notice with find_by is that it returns nil when the element is not found, which left you with not much clue of what went wrong. Thus, you can add ! to your code, and it will return error instead.
```rb
Book.find_by!(id: params[:id]) #returning error with find_by
```
